# More About the Dodge Mechanic (Dash)

The mod allows the character to perform a dash **without needing any accessory** that would normally provide this ability.

A dash consumes **30** stamina. If you don’t have enough stamina, the dash simply won’t start.

Immediately after the dash begins, the character gains **invincibility frames**, which completely protect them from any type of damage. During this state, the character can also phase through enemies.

The number of invincibility frames can be increased by raising the **Resistance** stat.

After the dash ends, there is a **0.66 second cooldown**, during which you **cannot dash**, even if you have enough stamina!

### More About Stamina

At stamina level 1, the character has a base stamina value of **60**.

Stamina begins regenerating almost immediately after it is used.

To display the stamina bar on screen, you need to select the **Dark Souls** theme in the game’s settings (Health and Mana Bar Style).
