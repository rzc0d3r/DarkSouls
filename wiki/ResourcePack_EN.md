# More about the resource pack for this mod

![](https://github.com/rzc0d3r/DarkSoulsResourcePack/blob/main/icon.png)

To activate all changes, you need to enable the resource pack and set it to the highest priority in the tModLoader settings!!!

Starting from version ```0.0.5```, the mod automatically installs the resource pack; all you need to do is enable it.

Starting from version ```0.0.6```, before changing any resource pack settings, you must **disable** the resource pack first, otherwise you will get an error!!!

2. Disables all standard player damage sounds (replaced by the main mod)
