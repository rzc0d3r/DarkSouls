### How to Level Up Stats

All of the listed stats can be leveled up through the **Level Up Menu**, which is opened by right-clicking on the placed **Bonfire (Dark Souls)** from the mod.

#### Level Up Menu

![](images/Menu_LevelUP.jpg)

This screenshot shows the level-up window of a newly created player.

The right panel is used for stat distribution. The left panel displays the resulting changes after pressing the **Accept** button.

The **Souls** value shows your current number of souls. If it’s red, you don’t have enough to level up; if it’s white, you do.

**ReqSouls** indicates the cost to raise your level by 1.

Each new level increases the required souls for the next level.  
For levels 1–26, the cost increases by 2.5% each level.  
From level 35 onward, a second (cubic) formula is used, increasing the cost non-linearly — the higher the level, the steeper the cost curve.

To increase a stat level, left-click (**LMB**) on the desired stat. It will highlight in blue.

To decrease a stat level (after increasing it), right-click (**RMB**) on the stat. If reduced back to the original level, it will turn white again.

After distributing points, click **Accept** (the button will light up if changes were made) to apply them and upgrade your player.

**Note:** If you walk away from the bonfire or press the hotkey that opens/closes the level-up window, all changes will be discarded!

All stats can be leveled from 1 to 99.

Each stat has its own **soft caps** that reduce the efficiency of further leveling.

### How to View Player Status

If you don’t click on the bonfire, but instead press the hotkey that opens/closes the level-up window, you’ll open the same menu, **but in read-only mode** — you can’t level up, and the left panel will change to display your **current stat values** (status), such as health, stamina, resistance, and so on.
