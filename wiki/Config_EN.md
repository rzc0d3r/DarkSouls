# More About Mod Configuration

---

The mod includes configuration settings that can be changed.

A detailed explanation is not provided here, as everything is described in-game — specifically in the tooltip for each setting.

### Note for the "Server and single-player config" Section

If you're playing in singleplayer, any changes you make in this section will apply immediately after clicking the "Save Changes" button.

If you're hosting a server, it will use the most recent values you last set in your own game.

So, before starting the server, make sure to adjust the configuration the way you want — then launch the server.
