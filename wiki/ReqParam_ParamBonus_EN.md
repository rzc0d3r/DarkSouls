# More About ReqParam and ParamBonus

---

All weapons and tools in Terraria now require a **minimum stat level** in one or more character attributes (**ReqParam**).  
In addition, most weapons and tools scale with your stats, granting bonus damage based on your attributes (**ParamBonus**).

### Scaling Grades

| №  | Scaling Grade | Multiplier   |
|----|----------------|--------------|
| 1  | S              | 0.85 (85%)   |
| 2  | A              | 0.5 (50%)    | 
| 3  | B              | 0.3 (30%)    | 
| 4  | C              | 0.2 (20%)    | 
| 5  | D              | 0.1 (10%)    | 
| 6  | E              | 0.05 (5%)    | 
| 7  | -              | 0 (0%)       | 

In practice, you don’t need to memorize the exact multipliers — just remember:  
**The closer the scaling is to S, the more bonus damage you’ll get per stat point.**

Grade 7 (represented as “–”) means **no scaling bonus at all**, which is expected.

### Additional Information

All **ReqParam** and **ParamBonus** values are shown at the **bottom of the tooltip** of each weapon and tool in Terraria (just hover your mouse over the item icon).

If you don’t meet the required stat levels, you simply **won’t be able to use** that item.  
Additionally, the unmet stat requirements will be highlighted **in red**.

If all required stat levels are met, the required stat values will be highlighted **in blue**.

Bonus damage is calculated as the **sum of all individual stat bonuses**, based on: **Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Faith**.

The amount of bonus damage is displayed in the weapon tooltip in **green text**, shown in parentheses after the base damage description.
